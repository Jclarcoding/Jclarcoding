## Hello, World ðŸ‘‹


About me:

School:

I am currently finsishing a degree in Full Stack Web Development at Arizona State University. I love coding! As I have started learning programming languages, it has become an obsession of mine. Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. I have studied and want to circle back on Powershell and Python in the future. But as of now, Javascript is my main focus. I have hopes of starting out as a front end developer but will continue to learn and refine my skills. 

Skills:


 

Hobbies:

When I am not coding, you can find me (or not find me) somewhere along a trail in the woods. I love nature and use it as a perfect release from everyday activities. I am also a gamer and love to watch and play different sports.
